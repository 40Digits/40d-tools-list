# Tools

This is simply a running list of common NPM modules that we use for development tools. Use this to help you tool your projects. Recipes are included for each type of tooling so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel for each project.

*Note:* Recipes use escaped double quotes (`\"`) so that you can easily copy and paste a script into your `package.json` file to use as an NPM script. If you would like to run one of the recipes directly from the command line you may need to remove the escape character (`\`) first.

## Contributing

**All recipes included in this repo need to work**. A dev should have the ability to use any recipe as an NPM script without modification, unless noted.

With that in mind, feel free to add packages and recipes that you feel would benefit other devs. If you happen to come across a recipe that doesn't work as described, please create an issue or better yet a pull request with a worthy update.

### All recipes should include the following:

- A breakdown of what the script does, with as much detail as would be helpful to others
- All packages that are necessary to run the script **along with their versions** at the time of writing/updating the recipe
- A reference to a Node.js file in the repo if it uses one
